# load-pkg [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/load-pkg.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/load-pkg)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/load-pkg.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/load-pkg)

> Loads the package.json from the root of the user's current project.

**HEADS UP!**

Breaking changes in v2.0. The main export is now a function that must be called. This is so that the package.json is lazily loaded when the function is called.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i load-pkg --save
```

## Usage

```js
var pkg = require('load-pkg')();
console.log(pkg.name);
//=> 'load-pkg'
```

Optionally specify a cwd or filepath to start from:

```js
var pkg = require('load-pkg')('a/b/c');
console.log(pkg.name);
//=> 'foo'
```
